Dirty Data Project
Set up the project folders and collaborators
downloaded the csv data
Revised the week 2 section on tidy data as data is not in the right format of long data with all the values attributed the the columns and the variable for the data
Clean the data
This data has row names - how do you get rid of them?
Not really want to get rid of them - we want to be able to convert a row name (the name of the people) to give is a column name.
So essential to use tibble
decathlon%>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column
This then needed to be assigned to a new variable (which i had not done)
<-decathlonclean then has to appear infront on the original data set and then appears in the data section.
  
  
This data isnâ€™t tidy.
You will want better column header names.
Not sure that i would agree with that - what improvement could be made?



Analysis Questions
Who had the longest long jump seen in the data? Clay 7.96 m - but this is from ordering the data once in the data set.  Not by using coding.
Did then do this with the select function and created a new variable (decathlonlong) and in the desc order - think it worked

What was the average 100m time in each competition?

Who had the highest total points across both competitions

What was the shot-put scores for the top three competitors in each competition?

What was the average points for competitors who ran the 400m in less than 50 seconds vs. those than ran 400m in more than 50 seconds?
