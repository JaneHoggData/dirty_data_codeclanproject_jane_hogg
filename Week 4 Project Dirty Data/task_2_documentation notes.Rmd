Clean the data
This data has row names - how do you get rid of them?
This data isnâ€™t tidy.
You will want better column header names.


Analysis Questions
Who had the longest long jump seen in the data? Clay 7.96 m - but this is from ordering the data once in the data set.  Not by using coding.

What was the average 100m time in each competition?

Who had the highest total points across both competitions

What was the shot-put scores for the top three competitors in each competition?

What was the average points for competitors who ran the 400m in less than 50 seconds vs. those than ran 400m in more than 50 seconds?
